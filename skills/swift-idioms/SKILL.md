# Swift idioms

Background knowledge consulted while implementing or reviewing Swift code. Each rule is written so a reviewer can check it against a diff. Rules marked as a preference are house style, not language rules. The rules target Swift 6 and later; version-specific syntax names the release that introduced it and was checked against Swift 6.4 (Xcode 27). Isolation, `Sendable`, tasks, and actors belong to `swift-concurrency`. SwiftUI, App Intents, and test migration belong to the skills Apple ships inside Xcode 27 (`swiftui-specialist`, `app-intents-specialist`, `modernize-tests`), exported with `xcrun agent skills export <dir>`; this skill covers the language, the compiler, the standard library, and naming.

## 1. Compiler configuration

- Use language mode 6 (`SWIFT_VERSION = 6.0`, or `swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]` in `Package.swift`). The concurrency settings that go with it are in `swift-concurrency`; read them before touching asynchronous code.
- Turn on `ExistentialAny`, which requires `any` in front of every existential type, and `MemberImportVisibility`, which requires a file to import the module of each member it uses instead of relying on another file's import. Xcode's app template enables the second (`SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_MEMBER_IMPORT_VISIBILITY`).
- Keep the build free of warnings. A warning that is always there hides the new one. Preference: `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` in CI, not in local debug builds.
- Silence one diagnostic at one declaration with `@diagnose` (Swift 6.4), for example `@diagnose(DeprecatedDeclaration, as: ignored)` on the function that must still call a deprecated API, with a comment saying when the call goes away. Do not turn the warning group off for the target.
- Guard newer APIs with `if #available` or `@available`, and set the deployment target deliberately; the compiler then lists every call that needs a check. `anyAppleOS` (Swift 6.4) covers all Apple platforms in one clause: `@available(anyAppleOS 27, *)`.
- Do not write an availability check for a version below the deployment target, and delete the ones that fall below it when the target is raised.

## 2. Optionals

- No `!` on an optional, no `try!`, and no `as!` in application code. Each one is a crash with no message at the place where an assumption turned out false. Unwrap with `guard let`, `if let`, or `??`, and cast with `as?`.
- When absence really is a programming error, say so: `guard let url = URL(string: endpoint) else { preconditionFailure("Invalid endpoint: \(endpoint)") }`. The crash then names what was expected. A force unwrap of a literal that cannot fail (`URL(string: "https://example.com")!`) is the one tolerated form, as a preference; `fatalError` in a required but unused `init(coder:)` is another.
- Do not declare implicitly unwrapped optionals (`var name: String!`). The remaining legitimate uses are `@IBOutlet` and values a framework sets before first use.
- Unwrap early and leave the function's main path unindented: `guard let user else { return }`. Use the shorthand `if let user` rather than `if let user = user`.
- A lookup that finds nothing returns `nil`, never a sentinel in the valid range (`0`, `""`, `-1`, `.distantPast`). Supply a default with `??` at the place that knows what the default means, not inside the lookup.
- Avoid `Bool?`. Three states are an `enum` with three named cases.

```swift
// BAD
let user = users.first { $0.id == id }!
let age = Int(text) ?? 0                      // 0 is a real age

// GOOD
guard let user = users.first(where: { $0.id == id }) else { throw LookupError.userNotFound(id) }
guard let age = Int(text) else { return .invalid(field: .age) }
```

## 3. Modelling with types

- Start with a `struct`. Use a `class` when instances have identity (two references must see the same mutations), when a framework requires one, or when the type owns a resource released in `deinit`. An `@Observable` model is a class for the first reason.
- Mark every class `final` unless it is designed for subclassing. Share behaviour through a protocol extension or composition before inheritance.
- Prefer `let`. A `var` property on a struct is fine when mutation is part of the type's meaning; a `var` that is assigned once in `init` is a `let`.
- Model state as an `enum` with associated values, not as a set of optionals and flags. `isLoading`, `items?`, and `error?` together admit combinations that never happen, and every reader has to rule them out again.
- Switch over the project's own enums without `default`, so adding a case produces a compile error at every place that must decide. For an enum from the SDK or another resilient module, end with `@unknown default`, which keeps the warning for cases added later.
- `if` and `switch` are expressions (Swift 5.9). Use them to initialise a `let` instead of declaring a `var` and assigning in each branch.
- Wrap an identifier or a unit in its own type when two values of the same primitive type must not be interchangeable: `struct UserID: Hashable, Sendable { let rawValue: String }`. A function taking `(UserID, TeamID)` cannot be called with the arguments swapped.
- A fixed set of wire values is an `enum` with `String` raw values; decode at the boundary and pass the enum inward. Decide what an unknown value means (a failing decode, or an `unknown` case) once per enum.
- Group constants and static helpers in a caseless `enum`, which cannot be instantiated: `enum Layout { static let spacing = 8.0 }`.
- Rely on synthesised `Equatable`, `Hashable`, and `Codable`. A hand-written `==` that skips a property is a bug waiting for the next property to be added.

```swift
// BAD
struct FeedState {
    var isLoading = false
    var posts: [Post]?
    var error: (any Error)?
}

// GOOD
enum FeedState {
    case idle
    case loading
    case loaded([Post])
    case failed(any Error)
}

func title(for state: FeedState) -> String {
    switch state {
    case .idle, .loading: "Loading"
    case .loaded(let posts): "\(posts.count) posts"
    case .failed: "Could not load"
    }
}
```

## 4. Protocols and generics

- Do not start with a protocol. Write the concrete type, and introduce a protocol when a second conformer exists or a test needs to replace the type at a boundary (network, clock, storage). A protocol with one conformer and no test double is indirection with no reader.
- For a parameter or return type, write `some P` first. It keeps the concrete type, so the compiler specialises the call and associated types stay usable. Write `any P` when values of different concrete types are stored together or the type is chosen at run time.
- Always spell the existential with `any`. `ExistentialAny` (section 1) makes the compiler require it.
- Use primary associated types to keep information: `some Collection<Post>`, `any Sequence<Int>`. Returning `[Post]` is still the right choice when callers index or store the result.
- Swift 6.4 accepts `some P?` and `any P?` for an optional opaque or existential type without parentheses.
- Add one conformance per extension (`extension Post: Codable { }`), with the members that conformance needs. The type's declaration then lists stored properties and nothing else.
- Constrain an extension rather than checking a type at run time: `extension Collection where Element: Identifiable` instead of `if let x = value as? any Identifiable`.

```swift
// BAD: boxes each argument and loses the element type
func total(of prices: any Collection) -> Decimal { ... }

// GOOD
func total(of prices: some Collection<Decimal>) -> Decimal { prices.reduce(0, +) }
```

## 5. Errors

- A function that can fail `throws`. Do not return an optional or a `Bool` to mean "something went wrong"; the caller cannot tell absence from failure and the cause is lost. `Result` is for storing an outcome or passing it through a callback, not for return types of new functions.
- Define errors as an `enum` conforming to `Error`, with associated values that carry what a handler or a log needs. Conform to `LocalizedError` only for errors whose message reaches the user.
- Typed throws (`throws(ParseError)`, Swift 6) fit code whose error set is closed and handled exhaustively in the same module, and generic code that forwards a closure's error type. Public and application-level functions stay with untyped `throws`: a typed signature turns every new failure into a source-breaking change.
- `try?` discards the reason. Use it only where "it failed" and "there is nothing" mean the same to the caller, and never to make a compile error about an unhandled throw go away. An empty `catch { }` is the same defect with more characters.
- Catch the errors the code can act on and let the rest propagate. A `catch` that wraps every error in a generic one erases what the caller needed. Never report `CancellationError` as a failure (see `swift-concurrency`).
- Release resources with `defer` next to the acquisition, so every exit path is covered.
- `precondition` and `fatalError` are for broken invariants, with a message. `assert` is removed in release builds, so it must not guard anything a release build depends on.

```swift
// BAD
func loadProfile() -> Profile? {
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: profileURL) else { return nil }
    return try? JSONDecoder().decode(Profile.self, from: data)
}

// GOOD
func loadProfile() throws -> Profile {
    let data = try Data(contentsOf: profileURL)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(Profile.self, from: data)
}
```

## 6. Standard library and Foundation

- Ask the collection the question directly: `isEmpty` instead of `count == 0`, `contains(where:)` instead of `filter { }.isEmpty == false`, `first(where:)` instead of `filter { }.first`, `count(where:)` (Swift 6) instead of `filter { }.count`, `allSatisfy` instead of a negated `contains`.
- Indexing an array out of bounds traps. Use `first`, `last`, `indices.contains(i)`, or a `for` loop over the elements when the index is not known to be valid, and `dictionary[key, default: 0]` instead of unwrapping and writing back.
- Do not use `enumerated()` to get indices: its offsets start at zero even for a slice. Use `indices`, or `zip(collection.indices, collection)`.
- A `String` is a collection of `Character`s (grapheme clusters), not bytes, and has no integer subscript. Avoid index arithmetic; use `prefix`, `split`, `firstRange(of:)`, or a regex literal (`/(\d+)-(\d+)/`).
- Match text the user typed with `localizedStandardContains`, which ignores case and diacritics the way the system search does, and sort text the user reads with `localizedStandardCompare`, which orders the way Finder does. `==`, `<`, and `contains` are for identifiers and keys.
- Format values with `FormatStyle`: `date.formatted(date: .abbreviated, time: .shortened)`, `price.formatted(.currency(code: "JPY"))`, `ratio.formatted(.percent)`, `names.formatted(.list(type: .and))`. Do not create `DateFormatter` or `NumberFormatter` for display, and never build display text with `String(format:)`. A fixed-format string for a machine (an API timestamp) uses `Date.ISO8601FormatStyle`, not a locale-dependent style.
- User-facing strings are localisable: a string literal passed to a SwiftUI view already is, and `String(localized:)` covers the rest. Do not concatenate translated fragments; interpolate into one string so translators can reorder it.
- Use `Duration` and `ContinuousClock` for elapsed time and timeouts, and `Date` only for points on the calendar. Take the clock or `now` as a parameter in logic that depends on time.
- Sort with `sorted(using: KeyPathComparator(\.name))` when ordering by properties; pass several comparators for tie-breaks.
- In `Codable` types, map names with `CodingKeys` or a decoder strategy, set `dateDecodingStrategy` explicitly, and keep the wire type separate from the domain type when their shapes differ. A domain type full of optionals because the server may omit fields has let the wire format leak inward.

## 7. Closures and memory

- A retain cycle needs a closure that is stored by an object it captures strongly. Write `[weak self]` for closures that are stored or long-lived (a callback property, an observer, a never-ending task), then `guard let self else { return }`.
- Do not add `[weak self]` by reflex. A non-escaping closure (`map`, `forEach`, `withLock`) cannot create a cycle, and a short task that finishes keeps `self` alive only until it does, which is usually what the code wants.
- Avoid `unowned`. It is a crash when the lifetime assumption breaks, in exchange for skipping one `guard`.
- Delegates and parent references are `weak var`. Swift 6.4 adds `weak let` for a weak reference that is never reassigned, which also lets a `Sendable` class hold one.
- Do not capture a value the closure will read later and expect the current one: a capture list (`[count]`) copies at creation, a plain capture reads at call time. Choose deliberately in callbacks that outlive the surrounding scope.

## 8. Access control and modules

- Default to `private`. Widen to the implicit `internal` when another file needs the member, and to `public` only for a deliberate API of a module. `private(set)` exposes a value while keeping mutation inside the type.
- `package` (Swift 5.9) is visible to every target of one Swift package and invisible outside it. Use it instead of `public` for helpers shared between a package's own modules.
- `fileprivate` is for the rare case of two types in one file sharing a member. Reaching for it often means the file holds two things.
- A file imports the modules it uses, each once, with no unused imports. When two modules export the same name, disambiguate with a module selector (`ModuleA::Item`, Swift 6.3) instead of renaming a local type.
- Preference: one primary type per file, named after it; extensions that add conformances may live in the same file, and `Type+Feature.swift` holds an extension that would otherwise double the file.
- Delete dead code instead of commenting it out; version control has it.

## 9. Naming

These follow the Swift API Design Guidelines on swift.org.

- Judge a name at the call site, not at the declaration. `friends.remove(at: index)` reads as a sentence; `friends.remove(index)` does not say whether it removes a value or a position.
- Omit words that repeat the type (`allViews.remove(cancelButton)`, not `removeElement`), and add a role word when the type alone says too little (`addObserver(_:forKeyPath:)`).
- A method with side effects is an imperative verb (`sort()`, `append(_:)`); its non-mutating counterpart is a participle or a noun (`sorted()`, `appending(_:)`, `union(_:)` beside `formUnion(_:)`).
- A Boolean reads as an assertion about the receiver: `isEmpty`, `hasUnreadMessages`, `canEdit`. Avoid negated names (`isNotHidden`), which turn conditions into double negatives.
- No `get` prefix; a factory method begins with `make`; a conversion initialiser omits the first label (`Int(text)`).
- Protocols that describe what something is are nouns (`Collection`); those that describe a capability end in `able`, `ible`, or `ing` (`Equatable`, `ProgressReporting`).
- Types and protocols are `UpperCamelCase`; everything else, including constants and enum cases, is `lowerCamelCase`. Constants are not `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` and carry no `k` prefix. Acronyms are cased as a unit: `userID`, `urlString`, `HTTPClient`.
- Label closure parameters and tuple members that appear in an API. Default arguments go at the end of the parameter list.

## 10. Format and lint

- Formatting belongs to a tool. `swift-format` ships with the toolchain (`swift format`); run it in CI in lint mode with a committed `.swift-format`. Formatting never appears in a review comment.
- Preference: add SwiftLint only for rules the formatter and compiler do not cover, keeping its default `force_try` and `force_cast` and opting in to `force_unwrapping` and `implicitly_unwrapped_optional`, which together check section 2 on every build. Do not run two tools that both rewrite whitespace.
- Every disabled rule, in the config or inline, has a comment saying why. An inline `// swiftlint:disable:next` names the rule and never disables all rules.

- [ ] Is every stored or long-lived closure free of a strong `self` cycle, and is `unowned` absent?
- [ ] Is every declaration as private as its uses allow, with `package` instead of `public` for package-internal sharing?
